## REPOSITORY OVERVIEW

### Project Context
- **ClickHouse.Driver** is the official ADO.NET client for ClickHouse database
- **Critical priorities**: Stability, correctness, performance, and comprehensive testing

- **Core ADO**: `ADO/ClickHouseConnection.cs`, `ADO/ClickHouseCommand.cs`, `ADO/Readers/`
- **Protocol**: Binary serialization in `Copy/Serializer/`, HTTP formatting in `Formats/`
- **Feature detection**: `Utility/ClickHouseFeatureMap.cs` (version-based capabilities)
- **Public API**: `PublicAPI/*.txt` (Roslyn analyzer enforces shipped signatures)
- **Config**: `.editorconfig` (file-scoped namespaces, StyleCop suppressions)

## PRIMARY REVIEW GOALS

### 1. Correctness & Safety First
- **Protocol fidelity**: Correct serialization/deserialization of ClickHouse types across all supported versions
- **Multi-framework compatibility**: Changes must work on .NET Framework 4.6.2 through .NET 9.0
- **Type mapping**: ClickHouse has 60+ specialized types - ensure correct mapping, no data loss
- **Thread safety**: Database client must handle concurrent operations safely

### 2. Stability & Backward Compatibility
- **ClickHouse version support**: Respect `FeatureSwitch`, `ClickHouseFeatureMap` for multi-version compatibility
- **Breaking API changes**: Public API analyzer enforces `PublicAPI/*.txt` - flag any breaking changes
- **Client-server protocol**: Changes must maintain protocol compatibility
- **Connection string**: Preserve backward compatibility with existing connection string formats

### 3. Performance Characteristics
- **Hot paths**: Core code in `ADO/`, `Types/`, `Utility/` - avoid allocations, boxing, unnecessary copies
- **Streaming**: Maintain streaming behavior, avoid buffering entire responses
- **Connection pooling**: Respect HTTP connection pool behavior, avoid connection leaks
- **Benchmarks**: No regressions in BenchmarkDotNet results

### 4. Testing Discipline
- **Test matrix**: ADO provider, parameter binding, ORMs, multi-framework, multi-ClickHouse-version
- **Coverage**: NUnit tests for unit coverage, integration tests for server interactions
- **Negative tests**: Error handling, edge cases, concurrency scenarios
- **Existing tests untouched**: Only add new tests, never delete/weaken existing ones
- **Coverage threshold**: Codecov uploads from `ClickHouse.Driver.Tests/coverage.<tf>.opencover.xml`

### 5. Configuration Compliance
- **Code style**: File-scoped namespaces (warning-level), 4-space indentation, CRLF line endings
- **Analyzers**: Respect `.editorconfig`, StyleCop suppressions, nullable contexts
- **CI workflows**: Tests, benchmarks, CodeQL, coverage, multi-version regression

## GENERAL REVIEW CHECKS

### Context & Consistency
- Consistent with existing architecture, naming conventions, folder structure?
- Surprising divergence from established patterns?
- Target framework conditional logic (`#if`, `.csproj` conditions) correct?

### Complexity & Maintainability
- Simplest approach that works? Overengineering? Duplication? Magic constants?
- Clear intent with comments on tricky parts, constraints, design decisions?
- GitHub discussion outcomes captured in code comments?

### Tests & Evidence
- Comprehensive coverage: positive, negative, edge cases, concurrency, large datasets?
- Flaky test considerations?
- Performance-sensitive paths have benchmarks?

### Documentation & UX
- User-visible changes documented (behavior, limitations, migration notes)?
- Intuitive from user perspective?
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance?

### Security & Resources
- Unsafe input handling? Resource exhaustion vectors? Connection/memory leaks?
- New dependencies properly licensed and compatible?

## CLICKHOUSE C# CLIENT SPECIFIC RULES (MANDATORY)

### Protocol & Compatibility
- **Protocol versioning**: Client-server protocol changes must maintain backward compatibility
- **Feature detection**: Use `ClickHouseFeatureMap` for version-specific behavior
- **Type system changes**: Type parsing/serialization changes require extensive test coverage
- **Async patterns**: Maintain proper async/await, `CancellationToken` support, no sync-over-async

### Configuration & Settings
- **Connection string**: Changes must preserve backward compatibility
- **Magic constants**: Replace with configurable properties/settings with sensible defaults
- **Feature flags**: Consider adding optional behavior behind connection string settings

### Observability & Diagnostics
- **Error messages**: Must be clear, actionable, include context (connection string, query, server version)
- **OpenTelemetry**: Changes to diagnostic paths should maintain telemetry integration
- **Connection state**: Clear logging of connection lifecycle events

### Public API Surface
- **Breaking changes**: Must update `PublicAPI/*.txt` files (analyzer enforces)
- **ADO.NET compliance**: Follow ADO.NET patterns and interfaces correctly
- **Dispose patterns**: Proper `IDisposable` implementation, no resource leaks

### Tests Policy
- **Existing tests**: Do NOT delete or weaken existing tests
- **New tests**: Required for bug fixes (regression tests) and new features
- **Test organization**: Unit tests in `.Tests`, integration tests in `.IntegrationTests`
- **Test data**: Use appropriate test data for type coverage (no production data)

## PERFORMANCE & ROBUSTNESS REVIEW

### Hot Paths
- New overhead in critical paths (type conversion, readers, writers)?
- Allocations, boxing, string conversions in tight loops?
- Async state machine allocations justified?

### Memory & Scalability
- Peak memory bounded? Large dataset handling?
- Connection pooling impact?
- Stream disposal and cleanup?

### Concurrency
- Thread-safety in shared state (connection, readers)?
- Race conditions in connection open/close?
- Lock scope and contention?
- `volatile` usage correct (often misused)?

### Fail-Fast & Observability
- Clear exception messages with context?
- Meaningful logs at appropriate levels?
- Network trace support maintained?

---

## SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION

### BLOCKER (Must fix before merge)
- Data loss, corruption, or incorrect results
- Protocol incompatibility with ClickHouse server
- Breaking API changes without `PublicAPI/*.txt` update
- Multi-framework compatibility broken
- Thread-safety violations causing crashes/deadlocks
- Security vulnerabilities or resource leaks
- Missing tests for new behavior
- Performance regression in benchmarks
- Deletion/weakening of existing tests

### MAJOR (Should fix, or justify)
- Insufficient comments for complex protocol/type logic
- Under-tested edge cases (null handling, overflow, concurrency)
- Magic constants not configurable
- Confusing UX or missing documentation
- Sub-optimal performance (allocations that could be avoided)
- Error messages unclear or lacking context

### NIT (Nice to have)
- Naming/style inconsistencies
- Minor typos or formatting
- Cosmetic refactors
