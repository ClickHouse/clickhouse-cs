**Breaking Changes:**
* **DateTime reading behavior changed for columns without explicit timezone.** Previously, `DateTime` columns without a timezone (e.g., `DateTime` vs `DateTime('Europe/Amsterdam')`) would use the server timezone (with `UseServerTimezone=true`) or client timezone to interpret the stored value. Now, these columns return `DateTime` with `Kind=Unspecified`, preserving the wall-clock time exactly as stored without making assumptions about timezone.

  | Column Type | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
  |-------------|--------------|--------------|
  | `DateTime` (no timezone) | Returned with server/client timezone applied | `DateTime` with `Kind=Unspecified` |
  | `DateTime('UTC')` | `DateTime` with `Kind=Utc` | `DateTime` with `Kind=Utc` (unchanged) |
  | `DateTime('Europe/Amsterdam')` | `DateTime` with `Kind=Unspecified` | `DateTime` with `Kind=Unspecified` (unchanged). Reading as DateTimeOffset has correct offset applied. |

  **Migration guidance:** If you need timezone-aware behavior, either:
  1. Use explicit timezones in your column definitions: `DateTime('UTC')` or `DateTime('Europe/Amsterdam')`
  2. Apply the timezone yourself after reading.

* **DateTime writing now respects `DateTime.Kind` property.** Previously, all `DateTime` values were treated as wall-clock time in the target column's timezone regardless of their `Kind` property. The new behavior:

  | DateTime.Kind | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
  |---------------|--------------|--------------|
  | `Utc` | Treated as wall-clock time in column timezone | Preserved as-is (instant is maintained) |
  | `Local` | Treated as wall-clock time in column timezone | Instant is maintained (inserted as UTC timestamp) |
  | `Unspecified` | Treated as wall-clock time in column timezone | Treated as wall-clock time in column timezone (unchanged) |

  Migration guidance: If you were relying on the old behavior where UTC `DateTime` values were reinterpreted in the column timezone, you should change these to `DateTimeKind.Unspecified`:
  ```csharp
  // Old code (worked by accident):
  var utcTime = DateTime.UtcNow;  // Would be reinterpreted in column timezone

  // New code (explicit intent):
  var wallClockTime = DateTime.SpecifyKind(myTime, DateTimeKind.Unspecified);
  ```

    **Important:** When using parameters, you must specify the timezone in the parameter type hint to have string values interpreted in the column timezone:
  ```csharp
  // Correct: timezone in type hint ensures proper interpretation
  command.AddParameter("dt", myDateTime, "DateTime('Europe/Amsterdam')");
  command.CommandText = "INSERT INTO table (dt_column) VALUES ({dt:DateTime('Europe/Amsterdam')})";

  // Gotcha: without timezone hint, UTC is used for interpretation
  command.AddParameter("dt", myDateTime);
  command.CommandText = "INSERT INTO table (dt_column) VALUES ({dt:DateTime})";
  // ^ String value interpreted in UTC, not column timezone!
  ```

  This differs from bulk copy operations where the column timezone is known and used automatically.

* **Removed `UseServerTimezone` setting.** This setting has been removed from the connection string, `ClickHouseClientSettings`, and `ClickHouseConnectionStringBuilder`. It no longer has any effect since columns without timezones now return `Unspecified` DateTime values without any timezone changes applied to what is returned from the server.

* **Moved `ServerTimezone` property from `ClickHouseConnection` to `ClickHouseCommand`.** The server timezone is now available on `ClickHouseCommand.ServerTimezone` after any query execution (the timezone is now extracted from the `X-ClickHouse-Timezone` response header instead of requiring a separate query).


**New Features/Improvements:**
 * Added support for setting roles at the connection and command levels.
 * Added support for custom headers at the connection level.
 * Added support for JWT/Bearer token authentication at both connection and command levels.
 * Added `InsertRawStreamAsync` method to `ClickHouseConnection` for inserting raw data streams (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.) directly from files or memory. Check out the examples on GitHub for usage examples of all the above.
 * When the query id has not been set, it will now be automatically generated by the client.
 * Added support for writing `byte[]` values to String type columns via BulkCopy.

**Bug Fixes:**
 * Fixed a crash when reading a Map with duplicate keys. The current behavior is to return only the last value for a given key.
